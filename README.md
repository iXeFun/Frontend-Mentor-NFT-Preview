I learned how to make the transition to change the background of the image by changing the opacity :

```css
.imgEther div{
    position: absolute;
    border-radius: 10px;
    background-color: hsl(178, 100%, 50%, 60%);
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    z-index: 999;
    top: 0;
    opacity: 0;
}
```
